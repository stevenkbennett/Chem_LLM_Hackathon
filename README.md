# Welcome to the 2023 Chemistry DigiFab Hackathon

## Challenge 1: Retrosynthesis Prediction

In this challenge, you will be given a set of molecules and their corresponding retrosynthesis. Your task is to build a model that can predict the retrosynthesis of new molecules.
In this challenge, the goal is to compare the performance of more tailored language models (the Molecular Transformer - https://github.com/pschwllr/MolecularTransformer) and more general language models (GPT-3) for the specific task of retrosyntyhesis prediciton. 
The challenge will be evaluated in the following way: 

## Challenge 2: Large Language Models for General Science

In this afternoon task, the goal is to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) at answering specific exam questions.
The starting point is the [knowledge extraction notebook](https://github.com/stevenkbennett/Chem_LLM_Hackathon/blob/main/Task_2/knowledge_extraction_notebook.ipynb) in the Task 2 folder.

## Using the automated scoring

Your progress on the challenges will be monitored using the automated scoring system. The general idea is to submit a pull request containing your best predictions. The scores will be calculated automatically and uploaded as a comment on your pull request. You can submit multiple predictions and track the progress of your scores over time.

The detailed instructions for using the scoring system are as follows:
1. Navigate to the hackathon GitHub page: https://github.com/stevenkbennett/Chem_LLM_Hackathon
2. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button and then “Create Fork”.
3. In your fork, click “Add file” then “Upload files”.
4. Drag and drop your “task_1_predictions.json” and/or “task2.txt” files to upload them.
5. Click “Commit changes” to upload your results.
6. Click “Contribute” and then “Open pull request”.
7. Click “Create pull request”. Your scores will become available after a few minutes.
8. To submit new test files, just upload them in your fork using the “Add file” button and the scores will be recalculated.
