## Challenge 1: Retrosynthesis Prediction

In this challenge, you will be given a set of molecules and their corresponding retrosynthesis. Your task is to build a model that can predict the retrosynthesis of new molecules.
In this challenge, the goal is to compare the performance of more tailored language models (the Molecular Transformer - https://github.com/pschwllr/MolecularTransformer) and more general language models (GPT-3) for the specific task of retrosyntyhesis prediciton. 
The challenge will be evaluated in the following way:

## Challenge 2: Large Language Models for General Science

In this afternoon task, the goal is to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) at answering specific exam questions.
