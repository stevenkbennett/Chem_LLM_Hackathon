Bond strength is determined by factors such as atomic size, electron shielding, and electronegativity. F2 has low bond strength due to repulsion between small, closely packed, highly electronegative fluorine atoms. In Cl2, larger atomic size reduces repulsion, increasing bond strength. Br2’s bond strength is lower due to increased atomic size and electron shielding. In I2, weaker bond strength results from greater atomic size and electron shielding.
In ClF3 and ClF5, Cl's oxidation state is +3 and +5, respectively, due to more electronegative F atoms. The hybridisation is sp3d for ClF3 (Trigonal Bipyramidal shape, 5 electron domains) and sp3d2 for ClF5 (Square Pyramidal shape, 6 electron domains), based on the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a good ligand due to its ability to donate a lone pair from the carbon end and accept electrons at the oxygen end, displaying a dipolar nature. Conversely, N2, while isoelectronic to CO, lacks this polarity. The strong triple bond in N2 limits its ability to engage in effective coordinate bonding with transition metals, making it a poor ligand.
GeH4 (Germane) would present a single peak in the 1H NMR spectrum, as all hydrogen atoms are in the same environment. The peak would be upfield, likely in the region of 0 to 1 ppm, due to the low electronegativity of Ge, which results in a lower shielding effect on the protons.
The expected maximum stable oxidation states for Ba, As, Ti, and Cr are +2, +5, +4, and +6 respectively. Ba, a group 2 metal, easily loses 2 electrons from the s-orbital. As, from group 15, can utilize all its valence electrons, including 3d and 4s electrons, for an oxidation state of +5. Ti, a transition metal, can lose the 2 electrons from the 4s orbital and 2 from the 3d orbital to achieve +4. Cr, an exception among transition metals, can lose its 4s electrons and 3d electrons, with additional stability in the +6 oxidation state due to half-filled 3d orbitals in Cr(VI) compounds.
Conductors (e.g., copper) have a lot of free charge carriers making it easy for current to flow, insulators (e.g., rubber) have almost no free charge carriers making current flow nearly impossible, while semiconductors (e.g., silicon) are in between, with charge carrier concentration that can vary, and even increase with temperature, facilitating controlled current flow.
Bloch's theorem states that electron wavefunctions in a periodic potential, like a crystal lattice, can be written as a product of a plane wave and a function with the same periodicity as the lattice. Mathematically, ψ_k(r) = u_k(r)e^(ik.r), where u_k(r) has the lattice's periodicity. This implies that electrons in a crystal behave as if they have a momentum defined by k, the wave vector, allowing band structures in solids and explaining phenomena like electrical conductivity and semiconductivity.
Phonons are quantized collective excitations representing atomic displacements in a crystal lattice. By applying quantum mechanics to the harmonic motion of atoms vibrating about their equilibrium positions, one derives quantized energy states, these vibrational modes are the phonons. The Fourier transform of the atomic displacement yields the phonon momentum space, linking the microscopic atomic displacements to the macroscopic phonon picture.
The key feature of the band structure in graphene is the presence of Dirac cones, points in the Brillouin zone where the conduction and valence bands meet at zero-gap, and the energy dispersion is linear. This leads to the unusual characteristic of charge carriers behaving as massless Dirac fermions, contributing to the exceptional electronic properties of graphene such as high electron mobility.
The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two fermions, like electrons in an atom, can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously, characterized by a unique set of quantum numbers. For instance, in an atomic orbital, two electrons can coexist due to their differing spin quantum number, which prevents them from having identical quantum states, leading to the structure of the periodic table.
