      "The key differences between conductors, semiconductors, and insulators lie in their energy band structures and optical properties. Conductors, such as metals, have partially filled bands in the conduction band, allowing for easy movement of electrons and high electrical conductivity (Simon2012 pages 187-188). Semiconductors, on the other hand, have a small band gap between the valence and conduction bands, making them insulators at low temperatures but allowing for thermal excitation of electrons into the conduction band at higher temperatures (Simon2012 pages 178-179). Insulators have a large band gap between the valence and conduction bands, resulting in a lack of mobile charge carriers and low electrical conductivity (Simon2012 pages 178-179). Additionally, impurities in crystals can have significant effects on the optical and electrical properties of materials (Simon2012 pages 187-188).\n",

      "Bloch's theorem states that in a periodic lattice, the eigenstates of the energy are also eigenstates of the lattice translation operator. The wavefunction of the electron does not grow or decay exponentially with distance, indicating that the probability density of finding an electron somewhere is unchanged on a lattice translation. The theorem guarantees that electrons in a perfect crystal retain wave-like properties and are mobile across the entire system. This allows for the use of simple plane-wave ideas to explain why electrons conduct electricity in a metal. The conservation of crystal momentum means that electrons do not scatter as they travel through the crystal. However, real-world factors such as impurities/defects, phonons, and electron-electron interactions can give rise to resistance (Lee2020, pages 71-73).\n",

      "One can go from atomic displacements to phonons by solving the equations of motion for a diatomic chain with different masses connected by springs. By substituting a trial solution in the form of plane-wave solutions with wavevectors in the first Brillouin zone, a simultaneous equation involving the frequency can be obtained. This equation can be written in matrix form and solved to yield eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which provide information on how the two species of particles move relative to each other. This information helps understand the behavior of phonons in the diatomic chain (Lee2020 pages 86-87).\n",

      "\n",
      "The Pauli exclusion principle is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. This means that electrons must have opposite spins in order to occupy the same orbital. When an additional electron is added to a half-filled shell, its spin must counter-align with the spins of the electrons already present in the shell. This is due to the spin orbit coupling, which causes the additional spin to want to counter-align with its own orbital angular momentum. This alignment of orbital angular momentum with net spin reduces the Coulomb energy of the system. The principle was discovered by Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 and is a key concept in understanding the behavior of electrons in atoms (Simon2012 pages 40-42, Simon2012 pages 214-215).\n",

This is supported by the bond dissociation energy values provided in Properties2023, which show that F2 has the lowest bond dissociation energy among the Group 17 diatomic molecules.

      "The isoelectronic N2 molecule is not a good ligand compared to carbon monoxide due to differences in their bonding mechanisms and orbital interactions. In N2, the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) is higher in energy than the 1ð orbital, while in carbon monoxide, the HOMO has a substantial weight on the less electronegative atom. Additionally, the A-B bonding orbitals of heterodiatomics, like N2, have a higher amplitude on the more electronegative atom. These differences in orbital interactions and electronegativity contribute to the N2 molecule being a less effective ligand compared to carbon monoxide (Radius1997 pages 4-4).\n",
