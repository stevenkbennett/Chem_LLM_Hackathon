    "# Extracting literature knowledge using LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will use large language models to extract knowledge from the scientific literature. Your goal is to develop an approach that can answer a series of chemistry and physics exam paper questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to complete this task\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two options to completing this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using ChatGPT, a fully trained large language model hosted through OpenAI.\n",
    "2. Using paper-qa, a package for answering questions based on PDF or text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on each of these approaches is outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest option is to use ChatGPT to answer the questions. To do this, simply navigate to https://chat.openai.com and create an account. You can ask questions to the large language model directly using the chat box.\n",
    "\n",
    "While directly pasting the question to the model will always get you an answer, in many cases it is unlikely to be the correct one. To achieve better results, you can try \"prompt engineering\". This is adding more information to the prompt (the question) to improve the reliability and accuracy of the results. Research has shown that simply asking the model to respond as if it were an expert can improve the answers given.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick introduction to prompt engineering is available here: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/a-beginners-guide-to-chatgpt-prompt-engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Paper-qa\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have previous Python programming expertise then we recommend trying the paper-qa approach. [Paper-qa](https://github.com/whitead/paper-qa) is a package for extracting and synthesising information contained in PDF and text files. Under the hood, it uses large language models (like ChatGPT) to:\n",
    "1. Decide which PDF files are relevant to a question.\n",
    "2. Extract the relevant information from PDF files.\n",
    "3. Summarise the extracted information into a final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "A benefit of paper-qa is that it can provide references to where its answer originates from, unlike ChatGPT which can confidently state incorrect information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The following questions have been taken from past chemistry and physics exam papers. In several cases, they require understanding and summarising different aspects of the subjects, which can make it difficult for a model like ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please ensure that all answers are less than 100 words. All answers will be truncated to this length when being marked. You can directly instruct the model to provide answers within this word count.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of questions is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chemistry questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Account for the variation in bond strengths of the Group 17 diatomic molecules (given in kJ mol-1) F2 (158) Cl2 (242) Br2 (192) I2 (151)\n",
    "2. What is the oxidation state and hybridisation of the Cl centres in ClF3 and ClF5?\n",
    "3. Carbon monoxide is a good ligand. Why is the isoelectronic N2 molecule not a good ligand?\n",
    "4. Describe the 1H NMR spectrum of GeH4.\n",
    "5. What is the expected maximum stable oxidation state for (a) Ba, (b) As, (c) Ti, (d) Cr?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physics questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the key differences between conductors, semiconductors and insulators?\n",
    "7. What does Bloch's theorem state about electron waves in periodic lattices?\n",
    "8. How does one go from atomic displacements to phonons?\n",
    "9. What is the key feature of the band structure in graphene?\n",
    "10. What is the Pauli exclusion principle?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uploading your results\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the list of your 10 answers, you should add them to your GitHub pull request for automated scoring. See the automated scoring documentation for more details on how this process works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each answer must be on a single line (and not contain any new lines). The answers should be ordered in the same order as above. Accordingly, the file that you upload should only contain 10 lines in total. If your file contains more or less than this, an error message will be shown. An example answers file is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is my answer to question 1.\n",
    "This is my answer to question 2.\n",
    "This is my answer to question 3.\n",
    "This is my answer to question 4.\n",
    "This is my answer to question 5.\n",
    "This is my answer to question 6.\n",
    "This is my answer to question 7.\n",
    "This is my answer to question 8.\n",
    "This is my answer to question 9.\n",
    "This is my answer to question 10.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should name your file: `task2.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using paper-qa\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook gives a quick introduction to using paper-qa, and should be used as the starting point for groups following option 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to download and install the necessary packages to run the notebook."
