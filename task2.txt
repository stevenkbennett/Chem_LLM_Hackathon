The variation in bond strengths of Group 17 diatomic molecules F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2, with values of 158, 242, 192, and 151 kJ/mol respectively, arises from the quantum mechanical behavior of their valence electrons. At the Brillouin zone center, the molecular orbitals generated from overlaps of the ns2np5 atomic orbitals contain both bonding and antibonding levels. The bond order, given by (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons)/2, determines bond strength. F2 has 4 antibonding electrons, reducing its bond order to 1. Cl2 has only 2 antibonding electrons, giving a maximum bond order of 2. Br2 and I2 also have bond order 2, but increasing atomic size leads to poorer orbital overlap and weaker bonds of 192 and 151 kJ/mol.

The 1H NMR spectrum of GeH4, a molecule with four equivalent hydrogen atoms, shows a single peak (singlet) due to the identical environment and magnetic field. Chemical shift (Î´) depends on electronic factors, integration value is 4, and no splitting (multiplicity) occurs because of the absence of neighboring protons. Precise values require experimental data. NMR serves as an essential analytical tool to study the structure and chemical environment of molecules containing hydrogen atoms, offering valuable insights into their properties.
