The bond strengths of Group 7 diatomic molecules (F2, Cl2, Br2, I2) vary due to atomic size, electron-electron repulsions, bond length, and bond energy. Moving down the group, larger atomic size weakens bonding forces, longer bond lengths decrease attraction, and increased electron-electron repulsions further weaken the bonds. Consequently, lower bond energies lead to weaker bonds and lower bond strengths for the diatomic molecules.
In both ClF3 and ClF5, the central chlorine (Cl) atom is bonded to fluorine atoms. In ClF3, chlorine has an oxidation state of +3 and exhibits sp3d hybridization, forming three sigma (σ) bonds with fluorine atoms and one lone pair. In ClF5, chlorine has an oxidation state of +5 and demonstrates sp3d2 hybridization, establishing five sigma (σ) bonds with fluorine atoms, without any lone pairs.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a good ligand in coordination chemistry due to its ability to donate a lone pair of electrons from the polar carbon-oxygen triple bond, forming stable metal carbonyl complexes. Conversely, isoelectronic N2 lacks a permanent dipole moment and electron-donating capability due to its symmetric, non-polar structure, making it ineffective as a ligand for metal complexes. The absence of a readily available lone pair of electrons hinders N2 from forming coordination bonds with metal centres. 
The 1H NMR spectrum of GeH4 shows a quartet at δ 4.55 ppm with a coupling constant 1J(H-Ge) of 97 Hz. This quartet arises from coupling between the four equivalent hydrogens and the 73Ge nucleus (I = 9/2). The integration of 4H corresponds to the four hydrogens. The chemical shift and narrow linewidth are characteristic of hydrogen directly bound to germanium in a tetrahedral environment. No other peaks are present since GeH4 contains only one signal from the equivalent hydrogens coupled to 73Ge.
The expected maximum stable oxidation states of Ba, As, Ti, and Cr are rationalized based on the tendency to achieve noble gas electron configurations. Ba forms Ba2+ by losing its two outermost electrons (6s) to achieve a [Xe] electron configuration, resembling noble gas xenon. Gaining three electrons to form As3+ (4p6) resembling noble gas krypton, achieving a full 4p subshell. Ti loses four valence electrons (3d2 4s2) to form Ti4+ ([Ar]), resembling noble gas argon. Cr loses all valence electrons (3d5 4s1) to form Cr6+ ([Ar]), achieving a full 3d subshell. This results in stable ions with full electron shells.
Conductors, semiconductors, and insulators primarily differ in their electrical conductivity. Conductors, like metals, permit free flow of electrons due to their loosely bound valence electrons. Semiconductors, on the other hand, have properties between insulators and conductors, with their conductivity increasing with temperature and in presence of impurities. Insulators, like rubber or glass, possess tightly bound electrons, hindering the flow of electric current.
Bloch's theorem states that an electron in a periodic potential has wavefunctions that can be expressed as the product of a plane wave and a periodic function identical to the lattice periodicity. This theorem is foundational to the solid-state physics, explaining phenomena like band structure of crystals.
In solid state physics, atomic displacements due to thermal vibrations can be expressed in terms of phonons. The quantization of these vibrations leads to phonons - quantized modes of vibration that behave as particles. The transition from atomic displacements to phonons is achieved through Fourier transformation, taking the system from real space to reciprocal space (k-space), where phonons are naturally expressed.
The key feature of the band structure in graphene is the presence of Dirac cones at the corners of the Brillouin zone, the so-called 'K' and 'K prime' points. At these points, conduction and valence bands meet, and the electron energy versus momentum relation is linear, causing electrons to behave as if they are massless and move at a constant speed, similar to photons.
The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two fermions (particles with half-integer spin) in a quantum system can exist in the same quantum state simultaneously. In other words, each fermion in the system must have a unique set of quantum numbers. This principle underlies the structure of the periodic table and the behavior of electrons in atoms, among other phenomena.
