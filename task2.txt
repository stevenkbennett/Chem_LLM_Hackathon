The variation in bond strengths of Group 17 diatomic molecules F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2, with values of 158, 242, 192, and 151 kJ/mol respectively, arises from the quantum mechanical behavior of their valence electrons. At the Brillouin zone center, the molecular orbitals generated from overlaps of the ns2np5 atomic orbitals contain both bonding and antibonding levels. The bond order, given by (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons)/2, determines bond strength. F2 has 4 antibonding electrons, reducing its bond order to 1. Cl2 has only 2 antibonding electrons, giving a maximum bond order of 2. Br2 and I2 also have bond order 2, but increasing atomic size leads to poorer orbital overlap and weaker bonds of 192 and 151 kJ/mol. Ultimately, the Pauli Exclusion Principle, dictating unique quantum states for each electron, coupled with quantized orbital energy levels, gives rise to the complex interplay governing halogen bond strengths.
